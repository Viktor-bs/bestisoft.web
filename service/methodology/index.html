			<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
			
			 <p>We use agile methodology to develop projects which provides a deeper level of engagement between the client and the development team. This allows greater flexibility for our clients in defining goals for the project and continuous improvement of the final product. It also allows for greater client interaction and puts constant pressure on the development team for continuous results. We keep you informed on the progress and have effective performance tracking. This will deliver transparent process and solutions with predictable costs and turnaround times
